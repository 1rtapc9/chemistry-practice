## No-AI Version (local question bank)
This build does NOT use OpenAI or any AI services. Questions are taken from `src/lib/questions.js`.
- To add or edit questions, update that file.
- The adaptive algorithm still runs (Grade 6 → 12).
- Supabase is used only for auth & persistence of attempts/progress (optional).
